I actually kind of like Vi the most. The key commands are really strange, but that seems to be the case for all of these editors. I really disslike emacs -- the way you have to make at least two commands to do anyting. Also the "C" in emacs documentaion is very confusing, because I thought it meant capitol C for the longest time, but it actually means control. At the moment I like Vi, because I used it most recently, but that could change. I don't find going into edit mode all that strange, so that's a plus. The one thing that's strange are some of the nave keys, how they're letter keys - increadibly disorienting.
